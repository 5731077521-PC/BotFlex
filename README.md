BotFlex 
=====================================================

BotFlex is an open source tool for bot detection and analysis tool. Though it was built initially with bots in mind, it works equally well for detection of general Internet malware. This is because BotFlex has been designed to be extremely modular. BotFlex is based on the principle that multiple sources of evidence strengthens the chances of infection, and therefore we maintain state (for some time) of hosts that have been previously observed to be engaged in 'bad' behavior.

Check ./botflex
