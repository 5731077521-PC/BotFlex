This folder contains scripts that were modified in Bro's source code.
Each file in this folder is named after the original file in Bro source
code that was modified. For example, the script in bro.bif should be added
to the corresponding file in Bro source code, i.e., /bro/src/bro.bif.

For BotFlex to run properly, Bro must be built from source AFTER applying 
these modifications.
