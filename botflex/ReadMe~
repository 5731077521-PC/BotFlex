			Getting BotFlex to work

============================================================================

My apologies for the installation process being so 'manual'! BotFlex
has not been packaged per se. This will happen soon, though. Until
that happens, here is a quick guide that explains how to get BotFlex 
to work (Nix only :-) Tested on RedHat and Deb). The good news is that 
BotFlex does not have any additional dependencies except for the ones it 
inherited from Bro. 

1. Download botflex from https://github.com/sheharbano/bsg/tree/master/botflex.
1. Download Bro source (which is a compressed folder of the form bro.tar.gz).
   For details, please look at Appendix (this is not optional).
2. Extract to a place of your choice, but remember the path.
2. cd to the folder where Bro was extracted and modify bro source code as 
   described in botflex/bro_modifications (5 minutes of copy pasting :-)). 
3. Assuming you are still in the directory where bro was extracted (bro),
   do the usual (i) ./configure (ii) make (iii) make install
4. Move botflex to /usr/local/bro/share/bro/site.
   Note: The above is the typical directory hierarchy of Bro unless you have	
         specifically changed the path during ./configure stage. If that's
	 the case, use the path you specified during configuration.
5. For best results, considering modifying 
   /usr/local/bro/share/bro/site/botflex/config.txt
   according to your own environment. In particular, take time to
   specify local network. The default thresholds will be effective unless
   changed in the file mentioned above.
6. Add the following line to /usr/local/bro/share/bro/site/local.bro
   @load botflex/detection/correlation/correlation
7. We are all set now. For live traffic analysis, do 
   bro -i <interface> local.bro
   For analyzing a previously generated trace file, do
   bro -r <file.pcap> local.bro
8. Log files will be generated in your current directory. Bots are 
   listed in correlation.log (TO-DO). Other log filenames are self 
   explanatory.

--------------------------Installing Bro-------------------------------------

The detailed quickstart guide can be found at http://bro-ids.org/documentation/quickstart.html.
To cut a long story short, we further summarize Bro download here:

1. Download Bro: 
   git clone --recursive git://git.bro-ids.org/bro
2. Get dependencies:
   (RPM/RedHat based Linux)
   sudo yum install cmake make gcc gcc-c++ flex bison libpcap-devel openssl-devel python-devel swig zlib-devel file-devel
   (DEB/Debian-based Linux)
   sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ flex bison libpcap-dev libssl-dev python-dev swig zlib1g-dev libmagic-dev
   (Others)
   Check the above page. Haven't tested on other platforms.
3. Set path.
   (Bourne-shell syntax)
   export PATH=/usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH
   (C-shell syntax) 
   setenv PATH /usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH
