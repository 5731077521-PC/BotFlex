This script takes a BotHunter file as input and produces an equivalent Bro log
for the same. The good thing about the latter is that you can awk it and mine
it on command line as much as you want. If you have Bro installed, you don't even
have to remember column numbers. Just do the following

cat <outputfile_of_this_script> | bro-cut <field_name1> [<fields_name2>,...] | awk <Do what you want>

Remember that awk now knows field_name1 as $1, field_name2 as $2 and so on.
