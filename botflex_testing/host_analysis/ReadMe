Based on a list of CnC server list and a list of subnets forming
the monitored/local network, this script lists unique active hosts
as they form connections. Based on whether a host contacts a known 
CnC server from the given list, each unique host is tagged as Bot
or Benign (results in host_analyzer.log).

Note that this will run only on the Bro that has been modified for
BotFlex, because Bro does not support file reading as we speak.
For building a BotFlex speccific Bro, please refer to botflex_manual.pdf
in a similar named folder in the root directory. Alternately, ReadMe
inside botflex/ can also be used.
